## Summary

A Regex or regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually, such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings. It is also used for input validation. Regular expressions are a commonly used technique in theoretical computer science.

In this tutorial, we will explore a specific regex pattern that looks for a match of an HTML tag.
